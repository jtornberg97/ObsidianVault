# Covenant

## Summary
Covenant is a significant topic in historical theology, often discussed for its impact on religious development, doctrinal interpretation, and socio-political influence.

## Key Points
- Outlined in the [[Torah]], idea that God had made a Covenant with the Jewish People
- Legal term meaning agreement, Jews follow the laws laid out in the [[Torah]] and God will protect them

## My Notes
