# Lecture 3 - The Historical Jesus

## Summary
- During the Second Temple period, Apocalypticism was not uncommon. Jesus was unique because his followers were convinced that he rose from the dead.

## Key Points

	- Then begins to appear more regularly
- Jewish sources Exist written by [[Josephus]]

			- Only reference to Jesus in the First Century CE
- Stories of [[Jesus|Jesus]] life were scarce outside of the [[Gospels]]
- [[Gospels]] are hard for historians

	- Written in [[Greek]] but [[Jesus|Jesus]] spoke [[Aramaic]]
	- Based on oral tradition
	- [[Gospels|Gospel]] = Good News not historical fact
	- Hard to know what is historically accurate vs what has been changed to fit the church's theology
- [[Mark (Gospel)]] is likely the most historically accurate [[Gospels|Gospel]] as it was the first one written
- [[Apocalyptic Jews|Apocalypticism]] was a widespread movement in early Judaism including in and around the time of Jesus 
	- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] defines as "The belief that the present age was ruled by forces of evil, and that God would soon overthrow them in a cataclysmic act of judgement to bring in a Utopian Kingdom ruled by his own [[Messiah]]"
	- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] argues that [[Jesus|Jesus]] was an [[Apocalyptic Jews|Apocalyptic]] teacher
	- i.e. [[Permanent/Dead Sea Scrolls]]
	- Mark 1:15  ([[Mark (Gospel)]]) is the first teaching of Jesus, suggests that the Kingdom of God is at hand
- [[Jesus|Jesus]] referred to the coming Messiah as the [[Son of Man]]
	- In [[Daniel]], Prophet sees beasts coming to destroy but the [[Son of Man]] comes down and reigns
	- Mark 8:38 ([[Mark (Gospel)]])
	- Mark 9:1 ([[Mark (Gospel)]])
	- Coming judgement brings destruction of world order, reversal of fortunes
	- Appears to have expected this all to happen within his own generation
- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] argues that his ethical teachings were meant to prepare people for the coming kingdom in their lifetimes
- Jesus went to Jerusalem (i.e. heart of Judaism) in the last week of his life to share his teachings during [[Passover]]
	- Showing that the coming Kingdom would apply to [[Sadducees]]
	- [[Sadducees]] were trying to prevent an uprising during [[Passover]] as these had happened before
