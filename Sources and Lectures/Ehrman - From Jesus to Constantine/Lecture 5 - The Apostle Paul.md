# Lecture 5 - The Apostle [[Paul]]

## Summary
- 

## Key Points

- [[Paul]] may be just as important to the spread of Early Christianity as [[Jesus]]
- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] says without Paul you would just have another sect of [[Judaism]]
- [[Paul]] did not repeat the teaching of Jesus but rather shared the resurrection 
- [[Paul]] as "Second Founder" of Christianity
	- Problems with this argument: Inherited his understanding from those before him
- 13/27 books of the [[New Testament]] claim to be written by [[Paul]]
- 15/27 are connected to [[Paul]]
- [[Paul]] as early Christian missionary, founded Churches all across Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, etc.

- Difficulties with Understanding Paul
	- A lot of books that were claimed to have been written by Paul were later deemed to not be written by him (pseudonymous)
