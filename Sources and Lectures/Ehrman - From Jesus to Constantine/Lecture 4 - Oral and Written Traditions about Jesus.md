# Lecture 4 - Oral and Written Traditions about Jesus

## Summary
- The resurrection narrative is critical to defining early Christianity. Without it, Jesus would have just been another prophet. Ehrman argues that his early followers selectively chose Old Testament passages that help fit this narrative

## Key Points

- Crucified people were not usually put into a tomb, [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] suggests that [[Joseph of Arimathea]] allowed him to be buried in a family tomb
- All Gospel sources both early and late say that the tomb was in fact empty
- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] says there are contradictions in the [[Resurrection Narratives in the Gospels]]
	- In [[Matthew (Gospel)]] the women are told to go tell disciples to meet Jesus in Galilee, [[Jesus|Jesus]] tells them to go and make disciples of the world, then leaves them
	- In [[Luke (Gospel)]], the women are told to tell disciples to stay in Jerusalem, [[Jesus|Jesus]] appears to them and ascends to heaven
- An effect of early followers belief in the resurrection is that:

> Christianity is not the religion that [[Jesus|Jesus]] proclaimed, but the religion that proclaimed [[Jesus|Jesus]]
>  
-Â [[Jesus|Jesus]] changes from prophet of the coming messiah to the [[Messiah]]
- Have to reconcile 
	1) Why he came? 
	2) Why did he die?
- No record in any [[Judaism]] source that the [[Messiah]] was going to die, meant to save Israel as a successor to [[King David]]
	- [[Messiah]] = anointed one
	- Greek Translation is Christos (i.e [[Jesus|Christ]])
- Various understandings of [[Judaism|Jews]] around who the coming [[Messiah]] would be, but all expected that he would be a figure of power
	- Isaiah 53:5-6 becomes important passage but doesn't mention a [[Messiah]]
	- Psalm 22:1 initially forsaken, gets special favor
- [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]] says that Christians looked for ways to make [[Jesus|Jesus]] the [[Messiah]] based on passaged around suffering from the [[Old Testament]] ![[Regions with Christian Churches 100 CE.png]]
- Christianity spread throughout Middle East through word of mouth, but where did people get their stories from?
- Authors of [[Matthew (Gospel)]], [[Mark (Gospel)]], [[Luke (Gospel)]], and [[John (Gospel)]] were likely highly educated Greek speaking Christians (i.e. not those who would have met or spoken to Jesus)
- [[Gospels]] were likely the result of oral tradition and some earlier writings that may no longer exist (i.e. [[Q Source]])
- [[Synoptic Problem]] = differences between the Gospels
	- [[Mark (Gospel)]] says that [[Jesus|Jesus]] died the day after the Passover meal was eaten
		- Mark 14:12 and Mark 15:25
	- [[John (Gospel)]] says that [[Jesus|Jesus]] died the day before the Passover meal is eaten
		- John 19:14
- In [[Mark (Gospel)]] Jesus teaches [[Apocalyptic Jews|Apocalyptic]] message, in [[John (Gospel)]], he talks primarily about himself
- [[Gospels]] not meant to be historical fact but rather a narrative
- Many early sources are gone but some still exist that didn't make it to Canon (i.e. [[Thomas (Non-Canonical Gospel)]])
- Method of salvation differs across Gospels
	- In Canonical Gospels, faith in Jesus --> [[Salvation]]
	- In [[Thomas (Non-Canonical Gospel)]], understanding the secret teachings of Jesus --> [[Salvation]]
