# Lecture 2 - The Religious World of Early Christianity

## Summary
 There was a lot of religious diversity in the Roman World, Judaism was just a small mostly regional religion. Paganism and Cult worship were prominent and offered practical Gods for everyday needs. While Jewish believes varied, the common threads were monotheism, the Torah, and Jewish Law.

## Key Points
- Greco-Roman World - The lands around the Mediterranean from 300BC - 300AD
	- [[Alexander the Great]] - [[Constantine the Great]]
	- Kingdom conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] was split into regions that were ruled by his generals, Hellenistic culture remains for centuries
	- Eventually [[Roman Empire]] conquers the land previously conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]
- Vast majority of people in the [[Roman Empire]] were [[Pagan|Pagans]] who adhered to local and regional [[Cult|Cults]]
- Christians were called [[Atheists]] by the [[Pagan|Pagans]] because they didn't worship "the gods"
- Emperors were considered divine, but not to the extent of some of the higher [[Pagan]] Gods
- Religion for these people was not a matter of reaching the afterlife, Gods were important because they could help people *now*
- To keep the population constant, women in the [[Roman Empire]] had to have an average of 5 children due to death rates
- Gods were meant to help with things that humans could not impact
	- Motivating factor of was fear of the Gods, if they were not happy they could bring natural disasters
- Religion sought [[Pax Deorum]], didn't demand spirituality but rather ritual practice (prayer and sacrifice, primarily animals)
	- Sacrifice done in temples
	- Usually a celebration was set aside for sacrifices and was one of the few times people in antiquity ate meat
- Doctrine was not a major issue in [[Pagan]] religion
	- As a result, religions were highly tolerant of one another
- [[Permanent/Judaism]] only made up ~7% of the Roman Empire
	- Spread across empire, not just in Palestine
- [[Henotheism]] vs [[Monotheism]] 
	- By one of the ten commandments being "you shall worship no other Gods before me", the implication is that Jews may have been worshipping other gods i.e. [[Pagan]]
- Having scriptural authority made [[Permanent/Judaism]] unique among early religions
	- [[Torah]] - First 5 books of the Old Testament outlined the rules for Early Jews to follow and how he had made a [[Covenant]] with them
- [[Torah]] was not seen as a burden but a gift 
		
> [!quote] Jewish Interpretation of the Laws of the [[Torah]] - [[Bart Ehrman|Ehrman]]
> "The one God who created the world has chosen us as his people and has given us his law that we should follow"

 - Jewish Law/Religion has a greater focus on ethics than [[Pagan]] religions
 - Diversity in [[Ancient Judaism]]
	 - Some jews were more interested in adhering to the Temple Cult (i.e sacrifices)
	 - Others stressed importance of keeping the laws given by God in the [[Torah]]
	 - Some emphasized staying pure in front of God (i.e. early [[Monasticism]])
	 - Others were focused on the coming intervention of God (i.e [[Apocalyptic Jews]])
