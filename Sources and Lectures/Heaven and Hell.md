### Preface

> it is important to realize that in the Christian West prior to the modern period—think, for example, the Middle Ages or, for that matter, the 1950s—virtually everyone believed that when they died their soul would go to one place or the other (or to Purgatory in painful preparation for ultimate glory). One of the surprising theses of this book is that these views do not go back to the earliest stages of Christianity. They cannot be found in the Old Testament and they are not what Jesus himself taught. Then where did they come from?

  

> The apostle Paul had different views of the afterlife from Jesus, whose views were not the same as those found in the Gospel of Luke or the Gospel of John or the book of Revelation.

  

> Our oldest sources of the Hebrew Bible do not talk about “life after death” but simply the state of death, as all people, righteous and wicked, reside in their grave or in a mysterious entity called Sheol.

  

> Starting in the sixth century BCE, Hebrew prophets began to proclaim that the nation that had been destroyed would be restored to life by God.

  

Early Jewish Apocalypticism

  

> Toward the very end of the Old Testament period, some Jewish thinkers came to believe this future “resurrection” would apply not to the fortunes of the nation but to individuals.

  

### Chapter One: Guided Tours of Heaven and Hell

> It is the earliest Christian forerunner of Dante’s Divine Comedy

  

Apocalypse of Peter is the earliest and most authoritative account of Hell

  

> “lex talionis” (“ the law of retaliation”), in which the punishment is modeled directly on the transgression (an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth).

  

> Altogether there are twenty-one sins and punishments. None of the punishments is reformatory: they are not meant to teach sinners a lesson so they will do better next time. On the contrary, they are all retributive and vindictive. And they will never, ever end.

  

> The author is not interested in providing an objective statement about what actually happens in heaven and hell. He has a set purpose in mind. He wants people to behave in certain ways and he is using his graphic descriptions of eternal torment as a way of convincing them.

  

> Passion of Perpetua,

  

> allegedly firsthand account of time in prison experienced by a Christian awaiting trial and execution.

  

> “catechumens” (converts being instructed in the rudiments of the faith)

  

> the

  

> The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (121–80 CE) maligned Christians who insisted on dying out of obstinacy (Meditations 11.3).

  

> Jesus’s own twin brother, Judas Thomas.

  

> Even today many people think of Thomas as the first to bring the gospel to India. That tradition goes back to the second-century account known as the Acts of Thomas. 9

> Underlying the man’s tale is a major ideological point made repeatedly by this entire long narrative: to be a truly committed Christian means abstaining from the pleasures of the flesh.

> Another chasm was filled with souls wallowing in mud and worms. These were women who had left their husbands to commit adultery.

  

Why so many sections of hell?

  

> The angels allow him to go and he returns from the dead, to the joy and surprise of his brother. Gad tells the king all about his near-death experience and pleads with him to sell him the massive palace in the sky, built for him by the Christian Thomas.

  

> It is a narrative exposition of the words of Jesus: “Sell your possessions and give to charity; make for yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure that does not fail, in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth corrupts. For where your treasure is, there also will be your heart” (Luke 12: 33–34).

  

> The ideas of a glorious hereafter for some souls and torment for others, to come at the point of death, cannot be found either in the Old Testament or in the teachings of the historical Jesus.

  

### Chapter Two: The Fear of Death

> I will give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart.… For great is your steadfast love toward me; you have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol. (Psalm 86: 12–13)

  

> O Lord, my God, I cried to you for help, and you have healed me. O Lord, you brought up my soul from Sheol, restored me to life from among those gone down to the Pit. (Psalm 30: 2–3)

  

> once deciphered, they were recognized as preserving a “flood narrative” from centuries before the biblical accounts of Noah. This older Babylonian myth may well have been the source for the ancient Israelite version.

  

> The gods are incensed at this violation of their divine prerogative and decide that one of the two supermen must die. Enkidu mourns because he knows it will be he,

  

> The Anunnaki, the great gods, assembled; Mammitum, who creates fate, decreed destinies with them. They appointed death and life. They did not mark out days for death, But they did so for life. (Gilgamesh, Tablet X, vi)

  

Election?

  

> More familiar resonances: immortality is lost because of the nefarious working of a sly serpent.

  

> We do not have any writings from Socrates himself. All we know of him comes from the works of his contemporaries, in particular Plato (circa 428–circa 348 BCE),

  

> antiquity, when no one made a clean distinction between realms we today would designate as the “religious” and the “political.” There were not even ancient Greek words that neatly distinguished the two,

  

> Socrates argues that people dread death as if they know it is a great evil. But how do they know that? In fact, death might be the greatest blessing; maybe it’s even better than life.

  

> “Death is one of two things. Either it is annihilation, and the dead have no consciousness of anything, or, as we are told, it is really a change—a migration of the soul from this place to another” (Apology 40c).

  

> Plato championed an essentially dualistic anthropology in which the body and soul are more or less at war with each other, with each one wanting what is at odds with the other. That is why, for Plato, physical pleasure is not the great good most people take it to be but the ultimate enemy.

  

> The goal of life is to escape the body by centering all thought and action on the part of the human that is immortal and comparable to the gods.

  

> Plato realizes that this entire view presupposes that the soul does in fact live on after death, and that is precisely what needs to be proved.

  

### Chapter Three: Life After Death Before There Was Life After Death

> The fear of death for many people in antiquity differed from the terrors of torment or horrors of actual nonexistence experienced by so many in the West today. It was instead the dread of losing out on everything a full life has to offer, everything that makes living pleasant.

  

> of oral traditions about part of the ten-year war the Greeks fought by the walls of Troy (the Iliad),

  

> ten-year escapades of one of the Greek heroes in the war, Odysseus, in his attempt to return home to his wife, Penelope, on the island of Ithaca (the Odyssey).

  

> In the various reflections on death in these books, one point is crystal clear: death is uncompromisingly final. There is no coming back. The point is made already in the Iliad by its central figure, Achilles, the greatest of the Greek warriors, who laments what he has seen on the battlefield: But a man’s life breath cannot come back again—No raiders in force, no trading brings it back, Once it slips through a man’s clenched teeth. (Iliad, Book 9, lines 495–97) 2

  

> But where does the life force go? For Homer and other ancient Greek authors, it goes to the underworld, where souls (psychai) have the form but not the substance of human life, and none of its goodness. The soul appears in the shape of the human it had left—bodily defects and wounds included. But there is nothing substantial or tangible about it. In that state, forever and ever, it does not experience any physical torment or pain—or pleasure either. Instead, the psychē exists as a mere “image” or “shade” (Greek: eidōlon) of the person.

  

> Those who have departed life are joyless, bodiless shades, with no possibility of pleasure or vibrancy of any kind. Tiresias calls the underworld “this joyless kingdom of the dead” (Odyssey, Book 11, line 105).

  

> The term “immortal” for Homer is synonymous with “divine.”

  

> once life slips from the white bones, and the spirit [psychē] rustling, flitters away… flown like a dream” (Odyssey, Book 11, lines 247–53)

  

> A better afterlife is not available to mere mortals, but the Odyssey recounts two exceptions for those with divine relations.

  

> A nice life if you can get it. But almost no one else can. It is not that Menelaus will die and his shade will go to heaven. Because he is a son-in-law of the king of the gods, he will never die but will instead be taken to the utopian Elysian Fields.

  

Elysian fields as common representation of Heaven (also in Passion of Perpetua)

  

> Of all the people who have ever died, there are only three mentioned during Odysseus’s trip to Hades who have it even worse than the displaced (Odyssey, Book 11, lines 660–89). These are the eternally tortured. Such torments, it needs to be stressed, are not among the options for most mortals. It is not clear why these three unfortunates were chosen in particular. 5 It is true that all of them did something particularly offensive to the gods, but then again, so do a lot of people. Possibly the three stand in for everyone who fits that rather dire category. They are Tityus, the Titan who had tried to rape the goddess Leto, and who is sprawled out over nine acres while vultures eternally eat his liver; Tantalus, who had sacrificed his own son and cooked him in a meal provided to the gods, who for his torment has lovely food and drink kept barely outside his reach forever and ever; and Sisyphus, who had captured Death when it had been sent to him and locked it up, preventing people from dying, and who, as punishment, is compelled to push a boulder uphill only to have it roll down again over and over and over again without stopping.

  

> These three will become the prototypes of hell as it develops later in Western traditions. 6

  

> It is impossible to overrate the importance of Homer on the culture and religion of ancient Greece. It is not that the Iliad and the Odyssey were “the Bible” the way the Hebrew Scriptures or the New Testament were for later Jews and Christians. No one thought these epics were “the inspired and infallible Word of God.” But they were thoroughly known and deeply influential for people in the Greek and Roman worlds as they thought about their lives and the nature of the divine realm.

  

> Virgil is best known for his epic the Aeneid,

  

> Most of the inhabitants of the underworld, however, are not to be found in one of these preliminary places. This is the very big difference from Homer. Now, in Virgil’s telling, most of the souls in Hades are either being punished for their sins or rewarded for their upright lives.

  

> Some six or seven centuries after the Homeric epics, Virgil does not populate Hades with shades that all experience the same boring and pleasure-free existence. He writes of hellish torments for some and heavenly glories for others. Most have to be punished for their sins before being given a second chance at life. Why such a change from Homer? What has led to this invention of heaven and hell?

  

### Chapter Four: Will Justice Be Done? The Rise of Postmortem Rewards and Punishments

> Plato himself did not invent the idea of rewards and punishments in the afterlife. He was building on earlier views, as he himself tells us. But it was Plato who most influenced later thinking, leading ultimately to the views of heaven and hell that developed centuries later in the Christian tradition.

  

> René Descartes (1596–1650). Descartes passed on to Western posterity the dualistic idea that body is made up of matter but the soul is inherently immaterial. Before his time, however, it was believed that the soul was indeed material, but of a vastly different kind of material from the realities we normally encounter through our senses. 2

  

> For Homer, the “real person” was the embodied flesh; the departed soul was simply a shade, the shadow of a person. For Plato it is the soul that is the real person; the body is the gross material that is to be sloughed off and left behind. Moreover, once that happens, when the soul leaves the body, it goes off to either a happy or a miserable fate.

  

### Chapter Five: Death After Death in the Hebrew Bible

> One thing they held in common was the deeply rooted sense of the inevitability and finality of death, a view that can be found in a number of passages of the Hebrew Bible.

  

> “We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up” (2 Samuel 14: 14).

  

> As waters fail from a lake and a river wastes away and dries up, so mortals lie down and do not rise again; until the heavens are no more, they will not awake or be roused from their sleep. (Job 14: 11–12)

  

> This is one key difference from the Greek thought represented best by Plato. Ancient Israelites did not subscribe to the view of the immortality of the soul. Souls are not inherently deathless, destined for an eternal existence. In ancient Hebrew thought, there was no “soul” in the Greek sense. This can be seen by the different terms used. The closest equivalent to the Greek psychē is the Hebrew nephesh. The nephesh, though, is not a soul, set in contrast to the body. Hebrew anthropology was not dualistic (body and soul) but unitary. Nephesh means something like “life force” or “life” or even “breath.” It is not a substance that can leave a person and exist independently of the body. It is the thing that makes bodies live. When the body stops breathing, it becomes dead matter. In modern terms, when you stop breathing, your breath doesn’t go somewhere. It just stops. So too with the Hebrew nephesh. The person is then dead.

  

> Most commonly, a person who dies is simply said to have gone to “death”—a term used some thousand times in the Bible. Better known but far less frequent, a person’s ultimate destination is sometimes called “Sheol,” a term whose meaning and etymology are debated. It occurs over sixty times in the Hebrew Bible, and there is unanimity among critical scholars that in no case does Sheol mean “hell” in the sense people mean today.

  

> But in fact, in most passages of the Bible where Sheol is mentioned, it may well simply be an alternative technical term for the place where an individual is buried—that is, their grave or a pit.

  

> Poetry in books such as Psalms, Proverbs, Job, and extensive passages of the prophets did not use rhyming schemes as in much English poetry. Instead of rhyming “sounds” at the end of lines, Hebrew poetry could be said to have rhymed “ideas.” There were various ways a poet could set up an idea-rhyming scheme, but the most common was to express the same idea in parallel lines using different words. In this scheme the second line simply rephrases the idea of the first. You can see this use of “synonymous parallelism” throughout any poetic section of the Hebrew Bible. Consider some verses from Psalm 2, for example. Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain? (Psalm 2: 1)

  

> The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together.… [But] He who sits in the heavens laughs; the LORD has them in derision. (Psalm 2: 2, 4)

  

> I want to stress this point because it is a key to interpretation of Hebrew poetry. In synonymous parallelism, the ideas of the two lines are fundamentally the same, even when put in different words. And that is significant for understanding how the Israelite poets understood “Sheol.”

  

> It is certainly possible that some of these authors were imagining Sheol as an actual holding pen for the dead, a pen never to be escaped. On the other hand, perhaps these uses were also meant to be metaphorical, simply to refer to the fact that people die and are buried: hence they “go down.”

  

> Sheol was the realm of death, to be avoided as long as possible. It is not that it was boring; it was that it was a complete diminution of life, to the point of virtual nonexistence.

  

> the terms used to describe Sheol are bleak, not because there is any pain involved, but because there is nothing involved. It is a realm of “forgetfulness” (Psalm 88: 12); “silence” (Psalm 115: 17), and “darkness” (Job 17: 13). God is not even present there and, since the deceased are dead, none of them can worship him: “The dead do not praise the LORD, / nor do any that go down in silence” (Psalm 115: 17). No one can experience the love and presence of God in Sheol/ the grave, since they are cut off from the land of the living:

  

> That is because God is the god of the living, not those who reside in Sheol: “For in death there is no remembrance of you; / in Sheol who can give you praise?” (Psalm 6: 5); “[ T] hose who go down to the Pit cannot hope for your faithfulness” (Isaiah 38: 18).

  

> The poets praise God, instead, for allowing them to stay alive for a while longer, making it possible for them still to praise him. And so we read: For great is your steadfast love toward me; You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol. (Psalm 86: 13) and: But he did not give me over to death. (Psalm 118: 8) and: O LORD, you brought up my soul from Sheol, restored me to life from among those gone down to the Pit. (Psalm 30: 3)

  

> Nowhere in the Bible, however, do we get the idea that one who lives a long and full life has any regrets at dying. This is a point emphasized by Hebrew Bible scholar Jon Levenson, who reasons that if death for the elderly were a horrible fate to be avoided at all costs, the book of Job would not have ended on the high note that “Job died old and contented.” More likely it would have added a comment about how he now, in death, was undergoing a horrible existence in which he was endlessly bored to tears and miserable forever. 4

  

> not all authors of the Jewish scriptures held to the view that death was the end of the story.

  

> in the portions of the Bible that describe the Law of Moses, we find several warnings to ancient Israelites that they are not, under any circumstances, to contact or interact with “the dead.” And so, for example, we find the command: “Do not turn to mediums or wizards; do not seek them out, to be defiled by them…” (Leviticus 19: 31). Mediums and wizards here do not refer to ancient precursors of Harry Potter; they are people who have powers to consult the dead for advice. This is made clear in the book of Deuteronomy: “No one shall be found among you who… practices divination, or is a soothsayer… or a sorcerer, or who casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead” (Deuteronomy 18: 10–11). Obviously, dead persons cannot be consulted if they no longer exist. Thus, whatever the elite and educated authors of Job, Psalms, and Ecclesiastes may have thought, other ancient Israelites believed the

  

> dead still do exist in some form and can communicate, if illicitly, with the living.

  

> The term “Elohim” is the Hebrew word for God—used typically for the God of Israel himself, but also applicable to other divine beings.

  

> What is most striking is Samuel’s own reaction to the situation: he is extremely upset that Saul has interrupted his rest: “Then Samuel said to Saul, ‘Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?’ ” (1 Samuel 28: 15). It is hard to interpret this reproach, but it appears that Samuel had been enjoying being dead. That does not necessarily mean that Samuel had a conscious existence in his dead state. It could equally suggest he was in a deep, even a dreamless sleep and was upset about being woken up. But either way, his death was not awful, terrible, and something to escape. It was pleasant. What was awful was being brought back to life.

  

> “and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me” (1 Samuel 28: 19).

  

> It is striking, though, that the divine spirit of Samuel knows what will happen on the morrow. Apparently the dead—at least dead prophets—know the future.

  

> As one of the leading experts on afterlife in the ancient world, Alan Segal, the late scholar of Judaism, unequivocally stated: “There are not any notions of hell and heaven that we can identify in the Hebrew Bible, no obvious judgment and punishment for sinners nor beatific reward for the virtuous.” 5

  

> To the surprise of many readers today, much of the discussion of “afterlife” in the Hebrew Bible focuses not on the fate of the individual at death but instead on the ultimate fate of the entire nation.

  

> Above all, Israel’s life, death, and afterlife is a central and abiding concern for the prophetic writings of the Hebrew Bible—from Isaiah, Hosea, and Amos in the eighth century BCE, to Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Habakkuk in the sixth BCE, on through just about all the prophets. If the nation “dies,” will it “live again”?

  

> Israelite prophets understood themselves primarily to be spokespersons for God. They were the ones who spoke God’s word to his people, the ones who communicated God’s message to those who very much needed it, usually in times of crisis. Their overarching concerns

  

> were their present contexts, which were almost always situations of impending or manifest crisis. The prophets proclaimed why the crisis had come, what the people should do about it, and what would happen if they refused. The Hebrew prophets, in other words, are grossly misunderstood if they are thought of as predicting the distant future, 2,500 years after their day.

  

> eighth-century-BCE Amos. Amos was living at a time in which the original nation of Israel had been divided in two after a civil war, with Israel itself in the northern part of the land and the nation of Judah, with its capital of Jerusalem, in the south.

  

> The mighty nation of Assyria, on the far eastern side of the Fertile Crescent, was

  

> on the rise and threatening to attack and destroy the nations of the Levant.

  

> Amos was himself from the southern kingdom of Judah, but he came into the north to make his proclamation: the Assyrians were being empowered by God himself. God was incensed at how the northern Israelites were living their lives, oppressing the poor, ignoring the needy, perpetuating injustice. They “oppress the poor… crush the needy… afflict the righteous… and push aside the needy out of the gate” (Amos 4: 1; 5: 12). Because they had not mended their lives and turned to the ways God had commanded, by working for fairness, charity, and justice, God would direct the Assyrian armies to attack, leading to massive devastation. And so Amos says, in powerful and gripping terms, They [the people of Israel] do not know how to do right, says the LORD, those who store up violence and robbery in their strongholds. Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: An adversary shall surround the land, and strip you of your defense; and your strongholds shall be plundered. (Amos 3: 10–11)

  

> Amos is principally concerned not merely with the coming death of individuals but with the destruction of the nation itself.

  

> The key point is that among some of the prophets, this idea of a future restoration of the nation after disaster is sometimes likened to a resurrection of the dead.

  

> Israelite prophets themselves. For them, the “resurrection” was not something to happen at the end of human history when individual bodies returned to life for eternal reward or punishment. It was instead a metaphor for the nation being given new life.

  

> Critical scholars have long recognized that the long book of Isaiah as it has come down to us is actually a combination of writings by different authors from different periods of history. 7 Most of the first thirty-nine chapters, with the exception principally of chapters 24 to 27, derive from the prophet Isaiah himself, who lived in Jerusalem in the eighth century BCE, about the time of Amos; he, like his contemporary, proclaimed a coming military disaster at the hands of the Assyrians.

  

> A century and a half later, sometime after the later destruction of Jerusalem by a different ancient Near Eastern power, the Babylonians, in 586 BCE, another prophet from Judah produced what is now chapters 40 to 55; the burden of his message was hope that God would restore the fate of the nation. Sometime later in the sixth century, yet a third prophet produced what is now chapters 56 to 66, discussing the difficulties that arose after the nation had started to rebuild itself.

  

> Somewhat later still, a prophet wrote what is now chapters 24 to 27, and these came to be inserted into the writings of “First” Isaiah.

  

> Isaiah 26: 19: Your dead shall live, their corpses shall rise. O dwellers in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is a radiant dew, and the earth will give birth to those long dead [literally: “shades”].

  

> the context of Isaiah 25–26 makes it crystal clear that the author is talking about the redemption—the “return to life”—of the nation of Israel in metaphorical language.

  

> Ezekiel was writing immediately after the destruction of Jerusalem at the hands of the Babylonians, and the burden of his message, in part, was that the nation would be restored. This is the context of his well-known description of the valley of bones in Ezekiel 37, a passage frequently misread by people who think the prophet is discussing the future resurrection of individuals at the end of time.

  

> Ezekiel is unambiguous about what is being predicted: it is the restoration of the fortunes of the nation: “Mortal [the term God uses to address Ezekiel throughout the book], these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are cut off completely’ ” (Ezekiel 37: 11). In other words, the people of the nation Judah are distraught that after their kingdom has been destroyed, it is like a valley of dry bones, completely dead, incapable of resuscitation. But God knows otherwise, and tells the prophet so in no uncertain terms: the people of Judah who have been taken into exile into Babylon will return to their own land and thrive again, fully alive once more, a nation under God:

  

> theodicy—that is, an explanation for how God can be fair and just, given what happens in the world.

  

> At a certain point, that also became an obsession of some ancient Israelite thinkers, who redirected thinking about death—the grave, the pit, Sheol, and the national restoration of Israel—to their personal identities. When they did so, they began to reapply metaphorical language of national restoration to individual resurrection.

  

### Chapter Six: Dead Bodies That Return to Life: The Resurrection in Ancient Israel

> After the period of the classical prophets, Jewish thinkers came to imagine that in fact there would be life for the individual who had died.

  

> God would reassert his sovereignty over this world and destroy everything and everyone who was opposed to him, bringing in the perfect, utopian world he had originally planned.

  

> God would miraculously bring them back into their bodies, and they would live, bodily, without any pain, misery, or suffering, for all time, in his most glorious kingdom.

  

> The doctrine of the bodily resurrection of the dead at the end of time originated about two centuries before the life of Jesus, and by his day it had become a common feature of Jewish thought.

  

> If there is only one God, and he is in control of the world, why do the people who try to follow him suffer for it? The problem of suffering is not very difficult to solve for polytheists. Anyone who believes in many gods can easily say that some of them are wicked and these are the ones who create such misery in this world. But if there is only one God, and he is both thoroughly good and ultimately sovereign, why do his chosen ones suffer?

  

> We have already seen one in the writings of the Hebrew prophets such as Amos and Isaiah. Their view was held by each and every one of the prophets: Jeremiah, Hosea, Joel—take your pick. It is that the people of God have sinned and God is punishing them for it. Suffering comes from God, to penalize his people for not living as they should. This is sometimes called the “prophetic” or the “classical” view of suffering.

  

Definition of "Prophetic" or "Classical" Suffering

  

> Maybe it would make sense that God ordained the destruction of the nation of Israel at the hands of the Assyrians as a punishment for the sins of the people. But if that’s the case, why, when the people repented and returned to God’s ways, doing their best to do what he demanded in his law—why then did they continue to experience social upheaval, political disaster, economic crisis, and military defeat? Moreover, if the key to a life happy and blessed by God is keeping his law, and the path to pain and misery is breaking it, why is it that the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer? Why do some people exploit the system, oppress the poor, snub the needy, violate every commandment God has ever given, and then grow rich, influential, and deeply satisfied with themselves—only to die and get away with it? And why do other people, meek and humble, quietly live their lives by being concerned for those in need, giving what little time and resources they have to help others, yet lead lives of personal misery filled with pain, illness, poverty, and oppression, and then die lonely and in pain? It would make sense if there were no God. Or if there were many gods, some of whom were nasty. But how can it make sense if there is only one God who is truly good and completely in control of this world?

  

> For these new thinkers, even if some suffering could come from God—for example, occasionally to punish sin—that is not why the massive suffering that has turned the world into a place of misery has devastated even the people of God. On the contrary, it is not God who causes the problem. Instead, God has cosmic enemies. They are the ones doing it.

  

> even though God is sovereign, there are other powers in the world,

  

> The devil went by different names in the Jewish tradition—for example, Satan and Beelzebul. You will not find him in the Hebrew Bible. To be sure, a figure known as “the satan” does appear in a couple of places, most famously in the book of Job (chapters 1–2), but there he is not the devilish opponent of God. He is one of God’s divine counselors who opposes humans but who still does God’s bidding.

  

> Modern scholars use the term “apocalypticism” to describe the Jewish view that God has cosmic opponents creating havoc on earth, destined to be destroyed in the end through a cataclysmic act of divine judgment.

  

> apocalypsis, the Greek word for revealing or unveiling.

  

> Christians have long argued that Isaiah 53 is a prediction of Jesus’s crucifixion and triumph over death three days later. But that is almost certainly a misreading of the passage, at least as the author originally intended it. The passage deals with the “suffering servant” of the LORD. But in its original context the servant does not appear to be the messiah.

  

> the idea of a suffering messiah is not found in any Jewish texts prior to Christianity.

  

> Jews consistently believed the messiah would be the great and powerful ruler who delivered Israel from its oppressors. He would be a mighty general or a powerful cosmic judge come from heaven.

  

> This part of Isaiah was produced after the Babylonian armies had destroyed Jerusalem and taken large numbers of the Jewish people into captivity in Babylon. 7 These exiles were suffering, and the prophet was writing in order to give them hope. Those in captivity were suffering for the sins of the people, which had led to God’s punishment of the nation, but they would be returned to their land and good things would come. These suffering ones are talked about as God’s “servant”: they are serving God’s purposes.

  

> Another reason for thinking Isaiah 53 does not refer to just one person, the future messiah who would die for sins, is that the passage describes the suffering of the servant as a past event,

  

> This is most clear in Isaiah 49: 3, where God directly addresses the servant: “And he said to me, ‘You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified.’ ” The suffering servant is Israel.

  

> Isaiah 53 is not originally about a future messiah; it is about the nation of Israel taken into captivity.

  

Ehrman's view is that Isaiah 53 is not predicting Jesus as the coming suffering Messiah, but rather that Israel is his servant suffering for him.

  

> The idea of a future bodily resurrection of the dead first occurs in a book that was not included in the Bible but was nonetheless one of the most popular Jewish writings in the final two centuries BCE, a book known today as 1 Enoch.

  

> Enoch, the first person never to have died. According to Genesis 5: 24, “Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him.”

  

> the oldest part, found in what is now chapters 6–36 of the longer collection, a section called by scholars the Book of

  

> Watchers, written, probably, some two or two and a half centuries before the birth of Jesus (250–200 BCE).

  

> This Book of Watchers is our first known apocalyptic text, a book filled with cosmic battles between good and evil. God intervenes to destroy the evil embodied in the Watchers so that good can return to the earth.

  

> Daniel certainly does not claim to be the last book of the Old Testament. Its author, writing in the first person, indicates that he was one of the Jews taken into Babylonian captivity in the sixth century BCE. But critical scholars have long known this is a literary ploy.

  

> written some four centuries later, during the time Judea, as Judah came to be renamed in the Persian period, was experiencing a dramatic period of intense persecution leading up to what is known as the Maccabean Revolt. 10

  

> In 323 BCE, not long after conquering the lands of the Levant, Alexander the Great died, still a young man. The territories he conquered were divided among his generals. For about a century, up to 198 BCE, Judea was controlled by the rulers of Egypt, the Ptolemies. It then passed to the hands of the rulers of Syria, known as the Seleucids. Some thirty years later things were very bad on the Judean front. The ruler of Syria, named Antiochus IV—more commonly called Antiochus Epiphanes—tried to unify his relatively vast empire by imposing Greek culture on it. Many of those in Judea welcomed this progressive thinking and supported the adoption of the Greek language, dress, culture, institutions, and even religion. Many other Jews were incensed that they were not allowed to worship according to their ancestral traditions and were even being compelled, on threat of death, to violate their kosher food laws and to stop having their baby boys circumcised. Antiochus was, in effect, forcibly trying to stop them from being Jewish. 11 Eventually, in 167 BCE, a revolt broke out, started by a family known as the Maccabees. It began as series of guerrilla skirmishes but eventually became a major uprising that led to the defeat of Antiochus’s forces and the ouster of the Seleucid overlords from the land. Judea became an independent state, and was to remain that way for a century until the Romans came in conquest, taking over the land in 63 BCE.

  

> A book of this sort is known as an “apocalypse,” a literary genre used to set forth an apocalyptic view that explains the cosmic reasons for the horrible state of earthly affairs and/ or reveals how God will eventually make right all that is wrong at the end of massive suffering and disaster, restoring his creation to its intended goodness, and bringing to justice all who have corrupted it (as, for example, in the New Testament book of Revelation,

  

> two reasons apocalypses are typically pseudonymous.

  

> one thing, if heavenly secrets are to be revealed, surely it makes best sense for them to come to a particularly great spiritual leader

  

> other advantage of making the author a famous religious figure of the past is that such books often purport to tell the future. They are meant to urge people who are suffering now to hold on for a little while longer, because God, very soon, will intervene to destroy the forces of evil and reward his people. One way this message is conveyed is by having the author—allegedly a person in the distant past—predict what will happen after his day, up to and beyond the time the real author is actually writing.

  

> The real author is clearly living during Antiochus’s reign, and he actually predicts Antiochus’s death in a final battle in the Promised Land (Daniel 11: 40–45). This particular prediction did not come true, showing that the book was produced sometime before Antiochus died in Persia in 164 BCE.

  

> Daniel is the first and in fact only book of the entire Hebrew Bible to predict that a resurrection of the dead would come at the end of time. It was to take place right after Antiochus died,

  

> Daniel 12: 1–3, is key to understanding this new Jewish view of the afterlife:

  

> the fact that Daniel indicates that “many” will be raised shows that he, unlike Isaiah 26: 19 or Ezekiel 37, is not talking about the collective, the entire nation of Israel. He is talking about individuals.

  

> This is the only verse in the entire Old Testament that uses the term “everlasting life.”

  

> The wicked are not so fortunate. “Some” of them too will be raised not to be glorified but to be put to shame and experience everlasting contempt. Are these the persecutors of the faithful Jews during the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes, the violent sinners alluded to in Daniel 11: 33–35? Or is it all those opposed to the Jewish people? Could it be the most wicked of all people, whether connected to Jewish persecution or not? In any event, it is striking, and possibly significant, that the author does not actually say they will undergo eternal torture; they are not said to be tormented forever but despised forever.

  

> Other early Jewish texts also speak of everlasting destruction—that is, annihilation—not eternal torture. This is the case with the first-century non-canonical book known as the Psalms of Solomon, which in poetic verse refers several times to the contrasting eternal fates of the righteous and the sinners:

  

> (Psalms of Solomon 13: 11)

  

> (Psalms of Solomon 3: 11–12)

  

> (Psalms of Solomon 15: 11–13)

  

> It is often said that the key difference between ancient pagan and Jewish views of the afterlife is that Greeks developed the notion of the immortality of the soul but Jews came to believe in the resurrection of the body. 15 Even though there is an element of truth in this characterization, it is far too simple and, in fact, demonstrably problematic.

  

> In Plato’s view the soul is inherently immortal. It simply always will exist because it is its nature always to exist.
